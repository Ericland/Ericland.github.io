### [[CV]](https://ericland.github.io/files/cv.pdf) | [[Resume]](https://ericland.github.io/files/resume.pdf) | [Research Statement]

I recently graduated from Cornell University with a PhD in Robotics advised by [Prof. Kirstin Petersen](https://www.ece.cornell.edu/faculty-directory/kirstin-hagelskjaer-petersen). My research focuses on leveraging swarms of simple robots combined with advanced mathematical models to develop error-tolerant multi-robot systems capable of building large-scale complex structures. The research theme spans diverse fields, including agent-based modeling, distributed algorithms, reinforcement learning, and physics-based simulations. 

I have five years of experience programming with Python and am familiar with deep-learning frameworks, including PyTorch and TensorFlow, and robotic frameworks, including ROS. I have also published several papers in high-end robotics conferences, including IROS, ICRA, and DARS. During my PhD studies, I received several fellowships, including the Jacobs and Merit-Based Fellowships, and I have been actively engaged in teaching courses in robotics and computer systems. 

For future work, I envision bringing artificial general intelligence to multi-robot systems to enable more intelligent and complex interactions, such as reasoning, correcting, and preventing complex errors through mutual interactions, and achieve goals far beyond the capability of an individual robot.
