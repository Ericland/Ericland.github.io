Hi I am Jiahe Chen. 
I am a recent graduate of Cornell University with a PhD in Robotics.
I am interested in leveraging swarms of robots with minimal onboard capabilities combined with advanced mathematical models to develop scalable error-tolerant multi-robot systems capable of building large-scale complex structures. 
My research approach is influenced by multiple diverse fields, including collective intelligence, agent-based modeling, probability theory and stochastic processes, and optimal transport theory.
