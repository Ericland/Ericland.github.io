## Aloha!

I am a Senior Applied Scientist at General Motors, specializing in robotic perception and robotic foundation models. 
My work focuses on developing advanced AI systems that enable robots to understand and interact with complex, real-world environments through multi-modal sensing, large-scale learning, and generative modeling.
I am particularly interested in developing safe and scalable robotic platforms that improve autonomy, reliability, and real-world deployment across industrial applications.

Before joining GM, I graduated from Cornell University with a PhD in Robotics advised by [Prof. Kirstin Petersen](https://www.ece.cornell.edu/faculty-directory/kirstin-hagelskjaer-petersen). My research focuses on leveraging swarms of simple robots combined with advanced mathematical models to develop error-tolerant multi-robot systems capable of building large-scale complex structures. 
During my graduate studies, I have published several papers in high-end robotics conferences, including IROS, ICRA, and DARS. I have also received several awards and fellowships, including Outstanding Academic Award, the Jacobs Fellowship, and Merit-Based Fellowship. 

In earlier epochs (pun intended), I received my Master's in ESE from University of Pennsylvania and my Bachelor's from Queen's University at Kingston. I have been fortunate to work with [Prof. Jan Van der Spiegel](https://www.seas.upenn.edu/~jan/) on Brain Machine Interface, and [Prof. Mark Daymond](https://smithengineering.queensu.ca/directory/faculty/mark-daymond.html) on Proton Accelerator.
