### [[Thesis]](https://Ericland.github.io/files/papers/BMI_Thesis.pdf) 
## Summary
- Worked with a joint team of Penn Engineering and Penn Medicine to design an ultra-low-power implantable chip that uses machine learning to classify neural signals from human brains in real time with high accuracy.
- Designed an implantable chip for safe neurostimulation treatment with minimum tissue damage.
