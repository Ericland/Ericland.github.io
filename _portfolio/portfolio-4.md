- Built an agent-based simulator in Python to simulate multiple brick-carrying climbing robots that assemble a user-defined 3D structure at an arbitrary scale.
- Developed a distributed algorithm to resolve deadlocks in large-scale multi-robot construction. 
- Developed a distributed error correction algorithm that utilizes stochastic decay processes performed by minimalistic robots to eliminate errors and ensure the long-term performance of large-scale construction
