## Summary
- Developed an error-tolerant distributed algorithm based on optimal transport theory to coordinate a swarm of minimalistic robots to build complex continuous terrains under motion noise and constraints.
- Developed a dynamical system model of the robotâ€™s interaction with granular material based on real data.
- Built a lightweight simulator in Python based on the proposed model that drastically reduces the computation time of simulating large-scale multi-robot construction with granular material.
