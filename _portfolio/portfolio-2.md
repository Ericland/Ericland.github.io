## Summary
- Built an agent-based physics simulator in Python to simulate multi-robot construction with granular material using Pymunk as the physics engine and Pygame for visualization.
- Developed a reinforcement learning training environment for the construction problem using OpenAI Gymnasium. Discovered optimal policies for several construction tasks using Stable Baselines3.
